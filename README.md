int main is in MainGameLoop.cpp under engineTester. I was short on time so I couldn't figure out how to get it out of debug mode, so it might be a bit slower than normal.
Its not a much of a "game" but I had to learn c++ and opengl in one week so I think its solid. just getting objects to render to my screen took forever so keep that in mind.

you can left click and drag to move camera left and right
