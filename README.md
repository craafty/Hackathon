int main is in MainGameLoop.cpp under engineTester. I was short on time so I couldn't figure out how to get it out of debug mode, so it might be a bit slower than normal.
The only way I know how to run this project is to downlaod the folder, right click, open with visual studio 2022, double click cmakelists.txt to open it, hit ctrl-s to save and reload it, go to MainGameLoop.cpp and hit ctrl-b to build, and finally you can then use F5 or the big green button at the top to play.
Its not a much of a "game" but I had to learn c++ and opengl in one week so I think its solid. just getting objects to render to my screen took forever so keep that in mind.
you can right click and drag to move camera up and down
you can left click and drag to move camera left and right
