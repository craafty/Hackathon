int main is in MainGameLoop.cpp under engineTester. I was short on time so I couldn't figure out how to get it out of debug mode, so it might be a bit slower than normal.
The only way I know how to run this project is to downlaod the folder, right click, open with visual studio 2022, double click to enter cmakelists.txt, hit ctrl-s to save, go to MainGameLoop.cpp and hit ctrl-b to build. you can then use F5 or the big run button at the top to play.
Its not a much of a "game" but I had to learn c++ and opengl in one week so I think its solid. just getting objects to render to my screen took forever so keep that in mind.

you can left click and drag to move camera left and right
